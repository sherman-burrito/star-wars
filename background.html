    <h2>Info</h2>
      <p>Here is a little background information on Star Wars. George Lucas had an idea for a space opera and it almost did'nt make the cut. This story is based on outer adventures like his child self favorites  "Flash Gordon" and "Buck Rogers".  Lucas was determined to make a different kind of movie. One that was fun and aimed at 14- and 15-year-olds.</p>
